cdo `v0.1.2` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This release includes the following bugfix:

- [#6 The --version and --help flags should always work](The --version and --help flags should always work)

If there is an error parsing task definitions, or no task definitions are found, cdo previously exits with an error message, even if it should only handle the `--version` or `--help` flags.

The `--version` and `--help` flag handling now always works, regardless of the presence or parsability of task definitions.
