cdo `v0.1.1` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This release includes the following features:

**Makefile generation**

`Makefile` can be generated from task definitions using the `-m/--makefile` flag. The generated `Makefile` can be executed without `cdo`.

If the `make` command is issued without parameters, a short help is displayed about the targets that can be used.

It is important to note that the `Makefile` will not use cdo's embedded shell, but the `bash` shell.
